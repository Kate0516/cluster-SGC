# cluster-SGC
A new model that use clustering algorithm to improve SGC to make it can deal with large-scale dataset without out-of-memory problem.

Graduation work in Sun-Yat Sen University, written by Zhen Gao.

Datasets used can be found on Github "GraphGallery". Before you run this code, you should install pytorch and METIS first, then download datasets and put them in ./datasets.
